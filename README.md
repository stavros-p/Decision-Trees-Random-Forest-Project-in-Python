# Decision-Trees-Random-Forest-Project-in-Python
For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com).
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.
